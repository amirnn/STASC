# STASC
Selected Topics in Algorithms and Scientific Computing

In this course we build a time integration package for general ODE and PDE purposes.

# ODE class
ODE class takes a systemfunction as a fanctor and an initial state and a vector consisting of time steps which can be linearly distributed or distributed based on derivative (gradient) magnitude (To be implmented in next weeks).


# Requirments
To be able to compile and run the program one should have Boost libraries and gnuplot software package installed. CMake will take care of finding and linking the correct files by itself. 

# Debug
If you had any problems or any suggestions you can reach me by [my email address](mailto::amir.nourinia@gmail.com) or you can raise an issue. :)
