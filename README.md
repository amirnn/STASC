# STASC
Selected Topics in Algorithms and Scientific Computing

In this course we build a time integration package for general ODE and PDE purposes.

# ODE class
ODE class takes a systemfunction as a fanctor and an initial state and a vector consisting of time steps which can be linearly distributed or distributed based on derivative (gradient) magnitude (To be implmented in next weeks).
